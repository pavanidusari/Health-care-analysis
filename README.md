In this project, we create into the realm of healthcare data management and analysis, employing Postgresql to extract valuable insights from a comprehensive healthcare census dataset. The project encompasses various stages, from database schema design to writing intricate SQL queries to address a range of problem statements.

Project Overview
This project aims to:

Design an efficient and normalized database schema to accommodate healthcare census data.
Import data from multiple sources into the respective schema tables.
Implement data integrity constraints and establish relationships between tables.
Develop SQL queries to address 5 distinct problem statements related to healthcare data analysis.
Project Phases
Database Schema Design: Begin by creating a well-structured database schema that reflects the complexity of healthcare data.

Data Import: Import data from diverse sources, including patient records, medical facilities, treatments, and diagnoses.

Schema Operations: Enhance data integrity by adding primary keys, constraints, and indexes to the schema.

Table Relations: Establish relationships between tables using foreign key constraints.

SQL Query Development: Craft SQL queries to tackle 5 unique problem statements, ranging from patient demographics to treatment effectiveness.

Performance Optimization: Optimize query execution through indexing and other performance-enhancing techniques.

Results Presentation: Present insights gained from SQL queries using tables, charts, and graphs.

Learning Objectives :
Gain expertise in database schema design and normalization techniques.
Acquire hands-on experience in importing and managing data within a Postgresql database.
Develop proficiency in crafting complex SQL queries for diverse data analysis tasks.
Understand the importance of data integrity constraints and effective table relationships.
Explore strategies for optimizing query performance to handle larger datasets.
Project Benefits :
Derive insights into healthcare trends, patient demographics, and treatment outcomes.
Empower healthcare administrators and policymakers with data-driven decision-making tools.
Enhance skills in Poatgresql database management and data analysis.
Confront real-world data challenges and refine problem-solving abilities.
